# Why Vim

[Back To Index](index.md)

Vim is a free and open-source editor that runs inside of the terminal.
This makes Vim a very efficient editor, instead of waiting seconds for it to open like other IDE's, you can wait milliseconds instead.

I modeled Doom Neovim off of Doom Emacs because I liked the way it looked.

Although I may have modeled the Doom Neovim colorscheming after Doom Emacs, I chose the Vim over Emacs because Vim has a more efficient,
streamlined approach that lets the user install and configure whatever plugin pleases them.
This allows for more extensibility and offers a more fine-tuned experience.
Emacs comes with a load of preinstalled stuff that no one needs, and while you could use the EVIL plugin for Emacs to emulate Vim,
it is slow due to the fact that Vim keybinds are a foreign concept to Emacs.

Although Emacs comes preinstalled with a ton of stuff, Emacs does offer some cool features
like image previewing and special characters along with varying font sizes.

I wish I could get these features inside Doom Neovim, but it is a pain to get image previewing working
and it is not cross platform.
